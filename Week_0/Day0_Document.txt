USing the small part(blue block) which has basic gates, transistors, IPs etc. This create GDSII sent to factory which is Tape-in we get the chips out which is called Tape-out by this we are going to get the chip for that we are going to provide the peripherals for the chip which is taped-out once we get the chip we can interface with different equipments which can work under 100Mhz to 130Mhz like Arduino boards, TV pannels, AC applications etc..
